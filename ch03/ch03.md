1. Write the output result of the following code.
<br>int x = 10;
<br>int y = 20;
<br>int z (++x) + (y--);
<br>System.out.println(z);
- 30
2. Write the output result of the following code.
<br>int score = 85;
<br>String result = (!(score>90))? "가":"나";
<br>System.out.println(result);
- 가
3. The following code is about when distributing 534
pencils to 30 students, getting how many can one person have
and how many remains at the end. Write the codes that would
fit into ( ) sequentially.
<br>int pencils = 534;
<br>int students = 30;
<br>
<br>// how many pencils per student
<br>int pencilsPerStudent = ( );
<br>System.out.println(pencilsPerStudent);
<br>
<br>// how many pencils are remaining
<br>int pencilsLeft = ( );
<br>System.out.println(pencilsLeft);
<br>
<br>- 534 / 30
<br>- 534 % 30
